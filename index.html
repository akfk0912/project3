  <h2 class="title"> Philosophy of Education </h2>
  <div class="block5">
     <p>The educational goal of Hongik University is to forge the strongest possible link between academia and industry to provide service for the benefit of all humankind&#46; The name "Hongik"&#44; translated into English&#44; literally means &#34;service to mankind&#46;&#34;
		 In pursuing this goal&#44; we prepare our students for varied careers&#44; and they are first encouraged to foster independent thinking&#44; free from the influence of others&#46; Intellectual independence is thus our first educational objective. Our second objective is the development of students&#39; cooperative spirit&#46;
		 Cooperation is vital for individual betterment during one&#39;s lifetime&#44; and it is this cooperative ability that we strive to cultivate in our students&#46; While each individual may live independently&#44; society also requires that individuals live in harmony with fellow human beings&#46;
		 People always learn from the knowledge and experience of others&#46; Hongik University strives to guide students to live in a community where human interaction is essential&#46; This spirit of cooperation&#44; our second objective&#44; will lead our students to work together for the betterment of humankind&#46;
		 Our third academic obective is the development of students&#39; creativity&#46; Creativity is vital in seeking individual happiness during one&#34;s lifetime&#44; and it is this creative ability that we want our students to have&#46; In short&#44; Hongik University inculcates students with values necessary to serve society as independent&#44; cooperative&#44; and creative professionals&#46;</p>
